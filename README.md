## About MiST
MiST is an application that continuously reads Journal and Status files generated by Elite Dangerous and collates relevant events to track mission stacking. Aimed specifically at Elite Dangerous commanders looking to make maximum profits via Pirate Massacre Mission Stacking, the tool is designed to provide helpful insights at-a-glance, whether docked in-station or out in the field. 

The inspiration for this project hails from personal experience and friends' interest in the ability to keep track of important information about each mission set and the consequencial pirate hunt. On top of these, pre-existing companion/assistant applications drove the core ideas behind how the project would work and the vision for what would make a successful end-product. Specifically, Tautomer's EDMMC (https://github.com/tautomer/EDMMC) provided the idea of what a base version of the tool should be able to do.

The application employs a Python back-end, and a HTML-CSS-JS front-end, linked together via the Python [Eel](https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel) library. To watch for updates in Journal and Status files, the Python library [Watchdog](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog) is used. Finally, the config file containing user preferences is in the YAML format, and the application executable is built via PyInstaller.
